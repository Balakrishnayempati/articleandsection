            <h1 id="fullstack">FULL-STACK</h1>
            <section>A full-stack developer is a versatile professional proficient in handling both the client-side and server-side aspects of a web or software application.
                 They can work on designing user interfaces, creating APIs, managing databases, and ensuring smooth integration between various components. Full-stack developers are adept at using multiple programming languages, frameworks,
                  and tools to deliver end-to-end solutions. They often collaborate with designers, project managers, and other developers to ensure seamless functionality and user experience. Their broad skill set enables them to handle tasks ranging 
                  from coding and debugging to deployment and maintenance, making them invaluable in dynamic development environments.

            <section>
                A front-end developer is a professional focused on creating the user-facing aspects of a web or software application, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing experience for users. They specialize in using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build interactive and responsive interfaces. Front-end developers work with frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, or Vue.js to design dynamic and engaging user experiences.

                Their primary responsibility is translating design mockups and wireframes into functional code, making sure the application looks and works as intended across different devices and browsers. They optimize performance, handle cross-browser compatibility issues, and ensure accessibility standards are met.

            <section>
                A back-end developer is a professional responsible for building and maintaining the server-side components of a web or software application. They focus on creating the logic, database interactions, and APIs that ensure the application functions effectively behind the scenes. Back-end developers use programming languages like Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, or JavaScript (with Node.js) to develop robust and scalable server-side systems.

                Their work involves managing databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB, to store and retrieve application data efficiently. They also ensure secure data handling, implement business logic, and optimize server performance. Back-end developers often design and integrate RESTful APIs or GraphQL to facilitate communication between the client-side and server-side components.
